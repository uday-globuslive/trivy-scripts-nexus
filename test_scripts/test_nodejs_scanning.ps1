Write-Host "`n2. Key improvements made:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "   ✅ Auto-creates package-lock.json for Trivy detection"
Write-Host "   ✅ Enhanced Trivy commands with --scanners vuln"
Write-Host "   ✅ Better Node.js package recognition"
Write-Host "   ✅ Proper extraction and post-processing"

Write-Host "`n3. How this fixes your issue:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "   Before: Trivy showed 'Number of language-specific files num=0'"
Write-Host "   After:  Trivy will detect package.json and show 'num=1' or more"
Write-Host "   Result: Proper vulnerability scanning of Node.js dependencies"

Write-Host "`n4. Understanding the original issue:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "   • Your .tgz contained package.json ✅"
Write-Host "   • But no package-lock.json ❌" 
Write-Host "   • Trivy needs lock files to identify package managers"
Write-Host "   • Scanner now auto-creates missing lock files"

Write-Host "`n5. Expected behavior now:" -ForegroundColor Yellow  
Write-Host "   • Scanner extracts .tgz files ✅"
Write-Host "   • Finds package.json files ✅"
Write-Host "   • Creates package-lock.json if missing ✅"
Write-Host "   • Trivy detects Node.js packages ✅"
Write-Host "   • Scans dependencies for vulnerabilities ✅"

Write-Host "`n6. Next steps:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   1. Run your scanner again on the same repositories"
Write-Host "   2. Check that Node.js .tgz files now show vulnerability results"
Write-Host "   3. Look for 'Created package-lock.json for Trivy scanning' in debug logs"
Write-Host "   4. Verify individual reports are generated for Node.js packages"
